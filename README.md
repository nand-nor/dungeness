# Dungeness: Crabby Practice

(Dungeness is a type of crab!)

Repo to practice DP and Graph problems with Rust! And possibly other problem types
Problem definitions pulled from LC

### Regex Match
So far have only implemented regex match using DP/memoization approach. Added some
niceties to reject invalid input before ever running them through the helper memo function.
