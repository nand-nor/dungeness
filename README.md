# Dungeness: Crabby Practice

Practicing Rust and brushing up on old algorithms/problem solving approaches. Main
focus is on graphs/DP, problem definitions pulled from LC with links where appropriate
(Re: repo name, dungeness is a species of crab :) ) 

### [Regex Match](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/)

####Status: 
Have implemented regex match using DP/memoization approach. Added some
niceties to reject invalid input before ever running them through the helper memo function.
Would like to also add in a graph impl and maybe for extra fun a finite automata approach?

### [Maximum profit in job scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/)
####Status:
Have implemented using a memoized approach, some trivial test cases pass. Need to
ensure that fail cases (bad input) return appropriately   

## TO DO

More DP! Possibly: [Set intersection size (at least two)](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-intersection-size-at-least-two/)
